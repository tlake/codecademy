'''
Write a function remove_duplicates that takes in a list and 
removes elements of the list that are the same.

For example: remove_duplicates([1,1,2,2]) 
should return [1,2].

Don't remove every occurrence, since you need to keep a single 
occurrence of a number.

The order in which you present your output does not matter. So 
returning [1,2,3] is the same as returning [3,1,2].

Do not modify the list you take as input! Instead, return a new 
list.

    for each in elements:
        if each not in filtered:
            filtered.append(each)
