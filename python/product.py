'''
Define a function called product that takes a list of integers 
as input and returns the product of all of the elements in the 
list.

For example: product([4, 5, 5]) should return 100 (because 
4 * 5 * 5 is 100).

Don't worry about the list being empty.
Your function should return an integer.

def product(integers):
    storage  = 1
    for i in integers:
        storage *= i
    return storage
